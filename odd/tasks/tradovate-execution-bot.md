# Feature: Tradovate/NinjaTrader Deterministic Execution Bot

## STATUS AS OF 2026-11-09 (read this first)
The architecture pivoted twice since this doc was first written. The
original plan (direct Tradovate REST/WS API) is a **confirmed dead end**:
Tradovate prop-firm/evaluation accounts cannot get API Access at all (see
Pivot History below). Current plan: **NinjaTrader 8 ATI (Order Instruction
Files) + a read-only NinjaScript AddOn for account telemetry**, running on
a Windows VPS (TradingVPS, Basic tier: 2 cores / 8GB RAM / $35mo) where NT8
is already installed and connected to the Lucid Tradovate account. User
connects to that VPS via Microsoft Remote Desktop ("Windows App" on Mac);
Claude has no remote-execution tool into it yet (no SSH confirmed/enabled)
— deployment there is still an open logistics question, see Open
Questions. User is migrating this project to the VPS via `git`.

`risk_guard.py` and the executor's decision logic are unaffected by any of
this churn — they're pure/deterministic and already tested green. What
changes each pivot is only the **transport** (how an approved order
actually reaches the broker) and how account state is read.

## Objective
A standalone, always-on executor that places/closes MNQ orders for
Alberto's Lucid Trading funded account using fixed, non-LLM rules, so it
can run without him watching a screen 24/7. Claude's existing
`day-trader-skill` pack (scanner/analyst/risk/broker) stays the signal
layer; this bot is the execution layer. No live LLM call ever sits in the
order-placement path — only hardcoded arithmetic.

## Why
Lucid Trading explicitly allows EAs/API bots on evaluation and funded
accounts (verified 2026-11-09 via web search — no special approval needed).
An LLM in the execution loop is unacceptably risky (latency, non-determinism,
hallucination) for a funded account with hard-dollar kill switches. Decision:
separate signal (Claude) from execution (deterministic bot).

## Account parameters (Lucid Trading, 25k Flex Eval — confirmed by user 2026-11-09)
- Profit target: $1250
- Max loss limit: $1000, drawdown type = **End of Day** (trailing floor recalculated once per day at EOD balance, never intraday)
- Daily loss limit: $600 (intraday, resets daily)
- Consistency rule: 40% (no single day's profit may exceed 40% of total profit counted toward the target)
- Instrument: MNQ, max 3 contracts per position
- Platform: Tradovate (REST + WebSocket API)

## Pivot history
1. **Direct Tradovate REST/WS API** (`tradovate_bot/client.py`, built 2026-11-09). Dead end: confirmed via web search that Tradovate prop-firm/evaluation accounts (incl. Lucid) cannot register an API key or OAuth client — only live funded brokerage accounts with $1,000+ balance and the API Access add-on qualify. `client.py` is unusable for the real funded account; its 45 passing tests only prove the (irrelevant) mocked-HTTP contract.
2. **Third-party webhook bridge** (TradersPost recommended after research — confirmed Lucid support + externally-callable webhook, unlike PickMyTrade which doesn't list Lucid at all, or Autoview which had no Lucid confirmation). Rejected by user: pricing scheme didn't work for them.
3. **Current plan: NinjaTrader 8 ATI + read-only AddOn.** NT8 is already installed on the user's VPS, connected natively to the Lucid Tradovate account. NT8's Automated Trading Interface (ATI) lets an external process submit orders via Order Instruction Files (OIF) — plain semicolon-delimited text files dropped in `My Documents\<NT Folder>\incoming\oif*.txt` — without porting any decision logic into NinjaScript/C#. Confirmed OIF syntax:
   - `PLACE;<ACCOUNT>;<INSTRUMENT>;<ACTION>;<QTY>;<ORDER TYPE>;[LIMIT];[STOP];<TIF>;[OCO];[ORDER ID];[STRATEGY];[STRATEGY ID]`
   - `CANCEL;;;;;;;;;;<ORDER ID>;;[STRATEGY ID]`
   - `CLOSEPOSITION;<ACCOUNT>;<INSTRUMENT>;;;;;;;;;;`
   - NT8 writes confirmations back to `...\outgoing\` (order state, position, connection state files) — but **no account balance / realized P&L file exists in ATI's outgoing set** (confirmed via NT8 docs).
   - Gap: `risk_guard` needs real EOD balance and realized P&L for the Lucid kill switches. A self-tracked Python P&L ledger was considered and rejected (could drift from the broker's real numbers, exactly where accuracy matters most for the $1000 EOD drawdown floor). Decided instead: a small **read-only NinjaScript AddOn (C#, ~50 lines)** that only reads `Account.RealizedPnL`/`CashValue`/etc. and writes them to a JSON file for Python to poll. No trading logic in that AddOn — it is telemetry only.

## Scope
- `tradovate_bot/` keeps its module boundaries, but the transport changes:
  - Replace `client.py`'s direct Tradovate REST/WS calls with an OIF-writer module (writes PLACE/CANCEL/CLOSEPOSITION command files to NT8's `incoming` folder; tails `outgoing` for order/position/connection confirmations).
  - New: a minimal read-only NinjaScript AddOn (C#) that exports account state (realized P&L today, total, EOD cash balance) to a JSON file on a short interval, for `risk_guard`/`executor` to read as its account-state input.
- `risk_guard` module: unchanged — pure, deterministic functions for daily-loss kill switch, EOD-trailing max-loss kill switch, consistency-rule check, and MNQ position sizing (hard cap 3 contracts). Already test-first, already green.
- `executor`: reads an approved order (same shape as `trader-broker`'s `trader/orders.json`), runs it through `risk_guard` using account state from the AddOn's JSON export, places it only if every check passes via the OIF writer, logs every decision and fill to local state files.
- Runs as a long-lived process on the Windows VPS (NSSM/Task Scheduler, not systemd — Windows host), not a chat-invoked skill.
- Explicitly OUT of scope: the order's trade logic (entry/exit timing) — that stays with the existing `trader-*` skills. This bot only decides "is this order allowed right now" and "send it."

## Constraints
- No LLM call anywhere in the execution path.
- No hardcoded credentials — env vars only (now largely moot for the OIF path itself, since ATI needs no API key; still applies to any remaining config).
- Kill switches must fail closed: on any ambiguous/missing account-state read, refuse to trade rather than guess.
- The NinjaScript AddOn must stay strictly read-only telemetry — no order logic, no decision-making in C#.
- Deployment target is the Windows VPS (TradingVPS Basic), not Mac. Mac is dev/test only for the pure-Python pieces (`risk_guard.py`).

## Open questions (blocking next implementation step)
- How will Claude actually touch the VPS to help set this up? User wants to migrate via `git` from Mac to VPS, and asked Claude to "already be on the VPS" — but there is no remote-execution tool available in this session (no SSH client configured, RDP is a human-only GUI). Needs: either (a) OpenSSH Server enabled on the Windows VPS with host/port/credentials given explicitly, or (b) Claude prepares code + exact commands here, user runs them on the VPS via RDP and pastes results back. Not yet decided.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Unit tests for risk_guard cover: under all limits (pass), daily loss breached, EOD max-loss breached, consistency rule breached, position size over 3 MNQ, ambiguous/missing data (fail closed). Evidence: `python3 -m pytest tests/tradovate_bot/test_risk_guard.py -v` → 24 passed. Still valid — unaffected by the transport pivot.
- [x] Executor rejects an order when any risk_guard check fails, and logs why. Evidence: `tests/tradovate_bot/test_executor.py::test_process_order_rejects_when_risk_guard_fails` and `::test_process_order_rejects_oversized_mnq_position` pass. Still valid; executor will be rewired to the OIF writer but this contract (reject + log) doesn't change.
- [ ] ~~Tradovate client authenticates against demo env...~~ SUPERSEDED — direct API confirmed impossible for prop accounts. `client.py` as written will not be used against the real account.
- [ ] ~~WebSocket listener reconnects...~~ SUPERSEDED — no WebSocket in the ATI/OIF path; replaced by tailing NT8's `outgoing` folder for confirmation files.
- [x] README documents env vars required and how to switch demo → live. Still accurate for the parts that remain (no hardcoded creds), but the demo/live Tradovate env var is moot under ATI — README needs a rewrite pass when the OIF module lands.
- [ ] NEW: OIF writer module places/cancels/closes a position via NT8 ATI and the resulting order/position confirmation files are correctly parsed. Not started.
- [ ] NEW: Read-only NinjaScript AddOn exports account realized P&L (today + total) and EOD cash balance to a JSON file NT8-side, and `executor`/`risk_guard` can read it. Not started.
- [ ] NEW: Whole stack (NT8 + AddOn + Python executor) runs unattended on the Windows VPS (TradingVPS Basic) without manual restarts. Not started — blocked on the remote-access open question above.

## Tasks
1. [x] Tradovate REST/WS client — `tradovate_bot/client.py`. Built, tested against mocks, but SUPERSEDED (dead end for prop accounts). Kept in repo as reference/for a possible future live non-prop Tradovate account; not deleted.
2. [x] risk_guard module + unit tests (test-first). `tradovate_bot/risk_guard.py` + `tests/tradovate_bot/test_risk_guard.py`, tests written before implementation, 24/24 passing. Still the current, correct decision engine.
3. [~] executor main loop. `tradovate_bot/executor.py` built against the old `client.py` contract; needs rewiring to the new OIF writer + AddOn JSON reader once those exist. Not yet redone.
4. [x] Process/runbook docs — `tradovate_bot/README.md`, `tradovate_bot/RUNBOOK_DEMO.md`. Both describe the superseded direct-API path; need a rewrite pass for ATI/OIF + VPS deployment once that's built.
5. [ ] NEW: OIF writer module (replaces client.py's order-placement role).
6. [ ] NEW: NinjaScript AddOn for read-only account telemetry.
7. [ ] NEW: VPS deployment runbook (git clone/pull on Windows VPS, Python install, NT8 ATI settings to enable, AddOn install into NT8, how to run executor unattended on Windows — NSSM or Task Scheduler, not systemd).
8. [ ] NEW: Resolve remote-access method (SSH vs. manual-RDP-with-pasted-output) so implementation/verification on the VPS can actually happen.

## Progress
- 2026-11-09: Created. First implementation pass (direct Tradovate REST/WS
  client + risk_guard + executor), 45 tests passing against mocks.
- 2026-11-09: Discovered direct API is a dead end for prop accounts.
  Researched bridges, recommended TradersPost — user rejected (pricing).
  Researched PickMyTrade (doesn't list Lucid) — rejected.
- 2026-11-09: Landed on NinjaTrader 8 ATI (OIF) + read-only NinjaScript
  AddOn for account telemetry, running on the user's existing NT8 VPS.
  Confirmed VPS plan (TradingVPS Basic, 2 core/8GB, upgraded from Starter
  for 24/7-unattended headroom) is adequate; VPS tier doesn't affect code
  correctness, only operational margin.
- 2026-11-09: User is migrating this project to the VPS via `git`. Asked
  Claude to already be set up on the VPS before continuing to code —
  blocked on remote-access method (see Open Questions). This status
  update written so it travels with the git migration.

Still true regardless of transport: `risk_guard.py` is pure, deterministic,
fail-closed, test-first, and already covers every Lucid risk-rule case —
**45 tests passed** as of the last actual run
(`python3 -m pytest tests/tradovate_bot/ -v`). That work is not invalidated
by any of the pivots above.

Not yet done: the OIF writer, the NinjaScript AddOn, rewiring `executor.py`
to use them instead of the old `client.py`, and anything that requires
actually touching the VPS.
